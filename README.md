# Helper++
Welcome friends. Helper++ was developed by me for me but maybe someone else wished similar software so thats why you have now possibility to try it. 
I am all the time open for feedbacks.
Enjoy it.
Dont forget you have Certificate in properties in setup file or after installetion in Helper++.exe which you can use for Security. Its for 1 year and even timestamped.
Helper++Setup is the file for installation.
Thanks for Philip Sagebring who has been testing Helper++.
