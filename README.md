# Helper++
Welcome friends. Helper++ was developed by me for me but maybe someone else wished similar software so thats why you have now possibility to try it. 
I am all the time open for feedbacks.
Enjoy it.
Dont forget you have Certificate in properties in setup file or after installetion in Helper++.exe which you can use for Security. Its for 1 year and even timestamped.
Helper++Setup.exe is the file for installation. I encrypted source code for more security so thats why google not recognize application after download.
I will fix bugs if they appear so come back for uppdates..
Thanks for Philip Sagebring who has been testing Helper++.

CURRENT Helper++Setup.exe FILE VERSION 0.0.0.4
